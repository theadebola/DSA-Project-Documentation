# DSA-Project-Documentation
This is my first project after taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on extracting valuable insights from Amazon product reviews. By exploring key parameters such as ratings, reviews, discounts, and pricing across different product category. We aim to understand customer behavior and product performance. Through a detailed examination of the dataset, this project provides insights that can drive better decision-making, help identify product strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately tell a compelling story about customer satisfaction. 

### Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is Amazon case study.xlsx., which was provided by Incubator Hub after completing their data analysis training program. The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages. It was shared for the purpose of hands-on project development and real-world data analysis practice.

### Expploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data. Using pivot tables and formulas, the following business questions were answered:

- How many products are listed under each category
- What is the total number of reviews per category
- Which products have the highest average ratings
- What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category
- Which products have the highest number of reviews
- How many products have a discount of 50% or more
- What is the distribution of product ratings (eg, how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
- What is the total potential revenue (actual price x rating count) by category
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (eg, <7200, 7200-7500, >7500)
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews
- Which categories have products with the highest discounts
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.. How many Number of Products per Category
