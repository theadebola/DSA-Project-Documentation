# DSA-Project-Documentation
This is my first project after taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on extracting valuable insights from Amazon product reviews. By exploring key parameters such as ratings, reviews, discounts, and pricing across different product category. We aim to understand customer behavior and product performance. Through a detailed examination of the dataset, this project provides insights that can drive better decision-making, help identify product strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately tell a compelling story about customer satisfaction. 

### Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is Amazon case study.xlsx., which was provided by Incubator Hubvafter completing their data analysis training program. The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages. It was shared for the purpose of hands-on project development and real-world data analysisÂ practice.
